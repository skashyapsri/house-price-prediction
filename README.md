## General Information
- Utilizing advanced regression techniques like Ridge and Lasso, the task involves making predictions on house prices.
- The company is currently evaluating potential properties for purchase, with the intention to enter the market.
- The company aims to determine the following: 1) Which variables hold significance in predicting house prices? 2) How effectively do these variables describe the price of a house?
- Employing data analytics, the company strategically acquires houses below their true values and subsequently sells them at a higher price.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Employing GridSearchCV from Model Selection, the model identifies the optimal lambda value for predicting house prices through ridge and lasso regression techniques.
